# Data analysis project - Inflation and the quantity of ecological goods sold in Denmark

The project is titled **Inflaiton and Ecological Goods** and is about how the growth in inflation affects the growth in the quantity of ecological goods sold in Denmark in the period between 2005 and 2022.

The **results** of the project can be seen from running [dataproject.ipynb](dataproject.ipynb).

I apply the **following datasets** fetched from Statistics Denmark using the API:

1. PRIS9 
1. OEK3

**Dependencies:** Apart from a standard Anaconda Python 3 installation, the project requires the following installations:
``pip install git+https://github.com/alemartinello/dstapi``

The project shows a weak negative correlation between the growth in inflation and the quantity of ecological goods sold in Denmark.

This repository contains  
1. Inaugural project. 
2. Data project. I fetch data from **Statistics Denmark** on **Inflation** and **Ecological Goods** in Denmark using an API. I show that there is a weak tendency for the quantity of ecological goods bought to decline, when the inflation is high and vice versa.
3. Model project. I model the solow model with human capital and extend the model with R&D, which implies two types of labor.
4. Exam project.

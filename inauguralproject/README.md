# Inaugural project

The **results** of the project can be seen from running [inauguralproject.ipynb](inauguralproject.ipynb).

**Dependencies:** Apart from a standard Anaconda Python 3 installation, the project requires no further packages.

The project displays the Walras exchange economy. Equilibria are found by maximizing the utility of consumer A and consumer B under different constraints for the allocation of good 1 and good 2, as well as for the prices. 

The project is missing coding to be completed.

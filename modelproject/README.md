# Solow model with human capital

The project is titled **Solow model with human capital** and presents the solow model with human capital. The project finds the analytical and numerical solution to the model and display the solution in a phase diagram as well as a transition diagram. The project further examines what happens, when a parameter values changes, and how this affect the transition and steady state.
The model is expanded by including R&D to the model and the solving for the new steady state. R&D implies having two types of labor in the model and the growth in technology will then depend on the R&D labor.


The **results** of the project can be seen from running [modelproject.ipynb](modelproject.ipynb).

**Dependencies:** Apart from a standard Anaconda Python 3 installation, the project requires no further packages.
